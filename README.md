PEEL
--------
Peel is the culmination of Creative Seminar 2016-17 at RPI; This illustrated memoir chronicles the life of a second-generation Chinese-American. Childhood artifacts have been collected and refurbished into the narrative, which revolves around the intersections of family, culture, art, and identity.

Currently, Peel is primarily images created in Procreate/Photoshop, layouts created in InDesign, some HTML/CSS, and a bit of jQuery. Goals for the future consist of changing layouts to be more interactive and promote better pacing, as well as prose and image edits for a more cohesive story.
